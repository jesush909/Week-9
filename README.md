# Week-9
Honeypots
The honepots I used were Dionaea with HTTP, Cowire, and Glastopf

Issues
I had a couple problems but what I would do is delete what I did and redo do it again and it will end up working. I also had to look up on how to download the json file because the command wouldn't work for me.
